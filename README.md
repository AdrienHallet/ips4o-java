# Question
Is ips4o a good contender in the Java Sorting Algorithm space?

# Simple benchmark
| Algorithm                        | Execution Time (ms) |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Java                             | 23                  |
| Java Parallel Array (PA)         | 26                  |
| IPS4o with traditional threads (T) | 45                  |
| IPS4o with Loom's virtual threads (VT) | 27                  |
| IPS4o with improved Loom's virtual threads (IVT) | 11                  |
